TO COMPILE AND RUN:

python p3DVR.py <topology.txt> <events.txt> <binary flag>


Files:

p3DVR.py - main DVR protocol functionaliy

networkclass.py - holds our Node class to represent a router and a linkConnection structure to represent a connection
between two routers

topology.txt - establishes the network

events.txt - presents the events that would happen

DESIGN

* Note - We were unable to finish our main implementation in order to complete the functionality for rounds and output
of text files with router tables. Some of the main structure is established to create routers and create the network. We
ran out of time after multiple debugging sessions to be able to update tables and display the result properly.
